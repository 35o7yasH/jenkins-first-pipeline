# jenkins-first-pipeline
My first Jenkins pipeline project â€” running a simple Node.js version check using a Docker agent.

This repository contains my first Jenkins pipeline written in a Jenkinsfile. It uses a lightweight Node.js Docker container (node:16-alpine) as the agent and runs a basic command to verify the Node.js version. This serves as an introduction to CI/CD with Jenkins and Docker.
